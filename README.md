Exercise & Energy: Finding the Best Workouts for Every Body

Overview

This project analyzes calorie burn across various physical activities, helping individuals understand how different exercises impact calorie expenditure based on body weight and exercise type. Through data-driven insights, visualizations, and statistical analysis, we explore the most and least effective workouts for calorie consumption.

Objective

Identify the highest and lowest calorie-burning exercises.

Categorize exercises based on intensity and variability.

Analyze how weight affects calorie burn efficiency.

Provide data-driven insights for optimizing workout routines.


Dataset

The dataset contains calorie burn data for different exercises across four weight categories (130 lb, 155 lb, 180 lb, 205 lb). It includes:

Exercise Type: Name of the activity

Calories Burned: Caloric expenditure for different weight categories

Calories per kg: Caloric efficiency per kg of body weight



Steps & Methodology


1. Data Collection & Initial Exploration

Loaded the dataset from CSV format.

Examined column names, missing values, and data types.

Conducted summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand calorie distribution.


2. Data Cleaning & Transformation

Renamed columns for consistency.

Checked and handled missing values (if any).

Converted numeric columns to appropriate data types.

Set the 'Exercise' column as the index for easy referencing.


3. Exercise Categorization

Created a function to categorize exercises into groups:

Walking

Running

Cycling

Cardio

Yoga & Flexibility

Strength Training

Household Activities

Added a new column 'Exercise_Category' for analysis.


4. Descriptive Statistics & Insights

Identified the highest calorie-burning exercises:

Running at 10.9 mph (5.5 min/mile) burns the most calories.

Cross-country skiing and high-speed cycling also rank high.

Found the least calorie-burning exercises:

Mild stretching, slow walking, and light household activities burn the least calories.


5. Visualization & Trends

Bar Charts: Displayed calorie burn differences across weight categories.

Line Plots: Analyzed calorie burn trends by weight class.

Box Plots: Identified outliers in calorie burn variability.

Scatter Plots: Showed calorie burn efficiency across exercise categories.


6. Efficiency & Variability Analysis

High-Variability Exercises (Calorie burn fluctuates significantly):

Running, cycling at high speed, stair climbing.

Low-Variability Exercises (Calorie burn remains steady):

Walking, stretching, golf, and light chores.


Conclusion

✅ Best for Maximum Burn: Running, Cycling, Cross-Country Skiing.
✅ Best for Steady Burn: Walking, Yoga, Household Activities.
✅ Weight Scaling Impact: Higher weight = more calorie burn, especially in cardio & strength workouts.
✅ Customizing Workouts: Individuals can optimize routines based on their goals (weight loss, endurance, flexibility).
