Fitness EDA Project
Overview
This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on fitness and activity data. The project aims to uncover meaningful insights by answering three key questions:

Did intensity and calories burned decrease over time? (Assigned to Mike)
Does more sleep lead to higher activity and calorie burn the next day? (Assigned to Dave)
Which exercises are most effective for calorie burn? (Assigned to Kashif)
This project will analyze patterns and correlations in fitness-related metrics such as activity intensity, calories burned, sleep, and exercise effectiveness using Python and visualization techniques.

Key Tasks
The project consists of the following major tasks:

Data Preparation:

Importing datasets for activity, sleep, calories, and exercise.
Cleaning and merging data for consistent formatting and completeness.
Data Exploration:

Identifying trends in intensity and calorie burn over time.
Analyzing the relationship between sleep and next-day activity.
Evaluating exercise effectiveness using calories burned per minute as a metric.
Data Visualization:

Creating visualizations such as scatter plots, line graphs, and bar charts to present findings effectively.
Results Export:

Summarizing insights into visual and written formats for presentation and reporting.
How to Set Up
Clone the Repository:
